\section{The Lattice Boltzmann Approach to CFG}
The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) provides an alternative formulation of fluid dynamics that circumvents many of these challenges. 
Instead of solving the Navier--Stokes equations directly, LBM models fluid flow through the evolution of particle distribution 
functions on a discrete lattice. Macroscopic fluid behavior emerges naturally from local interactions and streaming processes, 
resulting in an algorithm composed almost entirely of local, explicit operations. Thus in LBM a system of linear 
algebraic equations is solved through a series of local updates and data movements on a fixed lattice grid.
GPU acceleration is thus particularly effective for LBM simulations, as the method's inherent parallelism aligns well with the architecture of modern GPUs.
